So, if it’s biscuit week with a hint of chocolate, then… You’ve got it! You’ll then have six days to post photos of your amazing bakes tagging @stylistcakeoff and using the hashtag #stylistcakeoff.\n\nWe’ll then add your creation to our Instagram gallery. The Stylist reader with the best-looking bake each week (as we can’t taste what you’ve made, presentation is everything in this challenge) will then go through to the reader final and be in with the chance of winning their very own KitchenAid Artisan Mixer.\n\nAnd of course, the Stylist team will also be locked in a battle of the oven mitts. Each week, we’ll be taking on the same signature bake as you and inviting a professional judge to crown a Stylist team winner and boot out a loser. We’ve already completed our first challenge – a Madeira cake – which was judged by GBBO’s 2013 winner, Frances Quinn.\n\nSee how we did and get inspired to join in by following @stylistcakeoff on Instagram.\n\nFor details on how to enter and for specific T&Cs for this competition please click on the below link.
